                                setting-up
- django uses ORM(object relational mapper).
- 'python --version' show the installed python version (3.12.6).
- in node.js there's MVC(model, view, controller), while django use MVT(model, view, template).
- Model->database,  View->control,  Template->HTML.
- 'python -m venv folder-name' used to create virtual environment folder used to install libraries locally in a specific project not in the whole computer.
- '.\venv-folder-name\Scripts\activate' used to activate the created virtual environment folder.
- 'pip install django' install locally in project venv.
- '.\venv-folder-name\Scripts\deactivate.bat' used to deactivate the venv folder.
- 'django-admin startproject project-name' create new project with Django.
- 'django-admin startproject project-name .' copy the contents of the internal folder into the parent project.

                         django project settings files
- the file 'wsgi.py' run django with traditional servers.
- the file 'asgi.py' handle async and web-socket.
- 'settings.py' responsible of configuration (security, middleware, templates, database, installed apps, etc.)
- 'manage.py' responsible of the commands that boot the project (runserver, migrate, createsuperuser…).
- 'urls.py' contains routing admin path with 'admin' endpoint used to access the Django administration page enable managing the models (Users-Groups...).

                              manange commands
- 'python manage.py runserver' provides a link to localhost server.
- to run a project with runserver we must ensure the venv is activated first.
- 'python .\manage.py migrate' apply migrations(changes) in database and creates the database db.sqlite3.
- 'python .\manage.py makemigrations' show migrations(changes) applied on database.
- 'python .\manage.py createsuperuser' used to create new admin(username, email, password)

                            creating project apps
- 'python manage.py startapp app-name' create new django application.
- include the recently created apps in the project-settings/settings.py in the INSTALLED_APPS list.
- in project-settings/urls.py we connect any recently created apps' manually created urls files as the basic endpoints in urlpatterns list using include() as a second parameter in path().
- in a single app-> any created functions in app/views.py are connected to urls.py as a second parameter in path() after the endpoint.
- from django.urls import path, include used in urls.py urlpatterns[].
- from django.http import HttpResponse to return http response from views.py functions.
- from django.shortcuts import render to render html templates and pass the required variables in object collection{} as a third parameter
  ,where the first parameter is the passed 'request' and the second is the template file path to be rendered.
- python is sensitive to indentaion so in HTML template we must take care of the block indent between {% block [title or content] %} {% endblock %} and not to make manual save (ctrl+s).
- the third parameter 'name attribute' in path() in apps urls.py file used to access this url view from html template in anchor tag.
- from any internal python file module we have direct access to the project apps folders and can import their files content without direct export in them as long as the apps declared in INSTALLED_APPS.
- slugs properties declared in model class acts as indexes take the property unique=True.
- request argument passed to some views functions contain some attributes like 'User, Language, Session, Headers' handled by middlewares after sent from front template.
- the mark f'' in python means formatted string used when we want to inject a variable value inside a string sequence(string interpolation using {}).
- exception in python handled using 'try: - except Exception as e: '
- the path to images in static folder should be written in "{% static 'path' %}" or "{% static '' %}{{ string_variable }}[rest of the relative path]" in img.src in template file.


                            portfolio project
- 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- 'pip install psycopg2-binary'
- static files include css, js and images files.
- 'pip install mysqlclient'
- 'python manage.py collectstatic' this command create static folder in project folder differ from the one in project_settings.
- 'python -m pip install Pillow'
- 'python manage.py makemigrations'
- edit database data in setting.py in portfolio to match the created mySQL database in development stage
  , while in production mode we create .env file including secret_key, debug and database settings. with the format for example -> secret_key=env("[secret_key]") 
- 'python manage.py migrate'

                        mySQL command line client
- 'create database portfolio_db;' create database named 'portfolio_db'
- "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'port';" display the database variables data
- 'use portfolio_db;'
- 'show tables;' used after we connect the created mysql database with the models created in the project and migrate them.

                          digit_press_main
- 'pip install django-environ' to enable import module named 'environ'
- 'pip install pymysql' 
- manage some settings.py variables that depend on .env file by create it and declare these variables 
  (DEBUG, SECRET_KEY, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, EMAIL_HOST_USER[Gmail], EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD[google-app-password]).   
- 'pip install -r requirements.txt' will thro error because of the line 'tablib~=3.5.0' change it to 'tablib>=3.7.0' 
  then run the command again it will uninstall some installed libraries with latest versions and reinstall them with degraded versions to match the tablib.
- 'pip install drf-yasg' instead of 'rest_framework_swagger' which is deprecated and can't be installed
  ,then update THIRD_PARTY_APPS list in settings.py to match.
- 'pip install sorl-thumbnail'
- 'pip install pymemcache'
- 'pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt'
- 'pip install python-slugify'
- 'pip install fonttools'
- 'pip install python-dateutil'
- 'pip install django-tinymce'
- all of these previous manually installed modules wasn't declared in the original requirements.txt file got from github repo.
- 'python manage.py shell' then create the default systemsetting in shell by writing this code lines:
  from core.models.core import SystemSetting

  system_app, created = SystemSetting.objects.get_or_create(
      title='Digithup',
      defaults={
          'app': 'Digithup',
          'frontend_temp': 'creasoon',
          'home_index': 'creasoon',
          'backend_temp': 'good',
          'maintenance_temp': 'creasoon',
          'vendor': 'Inactive',
          'maintenance': 'Inactive',
          'membership': 'Inactive',
          'registration': 'NotNeedActive',
          'status': 'Active',
      }
  )

  if created:
      print("SystemSetting 'Digithup' created successfully.")
  else:
      print("SystemSetting 'Digithup' already exists.")
- 'pip uninstall django-tinymce -y' then 'pip install django-tinymce==3.7.1' solve the error or "cannot import name 'url' from 'django.conf.urls'".
